BACKGROUND---Federal law and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance require that agencies establish oversight mechanisms, systematically evaluate, and ensure the continuing security, interoperability, and availability of systems and their data. Specifically, the guidance requires a process, called \"security accreditation,\" for each system.Security accreditation is the official management decision to authorize operation of an information system. Security accreditation provides a form of quality control and challenges managers and technical staff at all levels to implement the most effective security controls and techniques, given technical constraints, operational constraints, cost and schedule constraints, and mission requirements. The accreditation decision is based on the implementation of a security plan, risk assessment, and other supporting documents. Systems must be accredited before beginning operation or after any significant change that could affect the protection of the system. In addition to continuous monitoring and continuous assessment requirements, USDA additionally requires that systems must be re-accredited at least every three (3) years, the end result being reflected in an official Authority to Operate (ATO) memorandum accepted by USDA \u2013 Office of Information Security (OIS), Compliance, and Policy Branch (CPB).In addition to security plans and other supporting documents, security evaluation plays an important role in the security accreditation process. This evaluation determines the effectiveness of these security controls in a particular environment of operation and the vulnerabilities in the information system after the implementation of such controls. The results of the security certification are used to reassess the risks and update the security plan for the information system\u2014thus, providing the factual basis for the authorizing official to render the security accreditation decision.The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has developed its own Risk Management Framework (RMF) Process Guide that is intended to provide a comprehensive and uniform approach to the RMF process. Individuals responsible for, or involved in the USDA RMF process, will use this guide as a resource to assist them in certifying and accrediting USDA systems. This guide and the CPB mandates the use of the Cyber Security Assessment and Management (CSAM) tool, which incorporates information and standards directly from National Institute of Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4, (or latest4Version) Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and NIST SP 800-53A Revision 1, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems.", "chunk_id": 8}, {"chunk": "3.

Systems in development will not have all of this documentation, but at a minimum will need to obtain information from the system's detailed design documentation. While gathering information, it is best to start by populating the basic system information into CSAM. Any of this information can be updated as the system moves through the process. The CSAM headings of \"System Information\u201d (Identification, Locations, Relationships, Narratives and Points of Contact), are areas that need to be filled out and completed before moving on to security categorization activities.5.3 Perform PTA, then PIA if needed With the information from section 2.1.1 gathered, perform a PTA based on the template in Appendix B. If indicated by the PTA, perform a PIA based on the template included in Appendix B. If privacy information and/or special handling are indicated by the PIA, then consideration of this is required during the next step - security categorization. Note: There shall be one PTA for each SSP and at most one PIA for each SSP.5.4 Security Categorization The primary goal of this step is to utilize NIST SP 800-60 Rev.1, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories (Volume 1 and Volume 2) in accordance with FIPS PUB 199 to categorize the information system. The System Owner categorizes the information within the information system to determine the impact that a compromise of confidentiality, loss of integrity, and/or the lack of availability would have on the mission of the agency. This impact determination (low, moderate, or high) establishes the security control baseline applicable to the system. The system categorization is entered into CSAM from the \u201cSystem Information\u201d \u2013 \u201cInformation Types\" section.8To perform a security categorization of any system requires knowledge of what information is contained within the system. It is important to determine the value of this information from the standpoint of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). This information is then utilized to determine the generic data categories from NIST SP 800-60 Revision 1 Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories: Appendices with their default values of high, moderate, or low for the CIA areas. The data categories equate to information types in CSAM. The default CIA values for each information type are also pre-populated in CSAM. Based on the value of the information in the system, these default values can be modified to be either more or less critical, as illustrated in the example below.Once all the information types have been defined and values have been assigned, the overall categorization of the system is the highest value identified for any of the categories. This is referred to as the \"high water mark\". For any assigned values (low, moderate, high) that differ from the NIST recommended values, an explanation or justification must be entered that clearly explains the reason for the change from the NIST recommendation.Systems that are made up of other systems/applications must include the information types for all the systems/applications involved.

A common control is a control that can be applied in its entirety to one or more organizational information systems. The control must be designated, assessed, and approved in writing as a common security control. There are a few points to remember when selecting common controls:Controls need to be inherited from the system that provides that service or capability. In other words, a program does not actually perform virus scanning, so the virus scanning controls cannot be inherited from a program. However, the virus scanning control could be inherited from the network or system the application resides on.Every common control (including the common portion of a hybrid control) must identify the exact program/system that the control is common to. The program/system should have: (1) a control implementation that satisfactorily documents the control in terms broad enough to include the systems that should inherit the control; and (2) tested the control as part of an A&A.Hybrid controls require a further explanation as to what is being inherited along with the nameof the program/system from which it is being inherited.10The following control restrictions exist:o The following NIST SP 800-53, Revision 4 controls are system-specific controls and cannot be common, hybrid, or not applicable: AU-2, AU-2(3), CA-2, CA-2(1), CA-2 (2) (for high systems), CA-3, CA-3 (5), CA-5, CA- 6, CM-2, CM-2(1), CM-2(3), CM- 4, PL-2, PL-2 (3), RA-2, RA-3, SA-5.o For systems that contain PII \u2013 these controls are not common, hybrid, or not", "chunk_id": 21}, {"chunk": "applicable: AP-2, AR-7, and DM-2.---o For systems that contain PII \u2013 these controls are hybrid with the department, theycannot be common or not applicable: AP-1, TR-1.o For systems that do not contain PII: All the privacy controls including all theirenhancements must be made N/A with the reason that the system does not contain privacy information.o The CP-2 and CP-4 controls can be common controls if the CP for the system inquestion is: (1) a CP that covers multiple systems or a GSS; and (2) the control was previously tested during the assessment of another system covered by the CP. If the system has its own CP, these are system specific controls.o The Program Management (PM) family of controls can be inherited from the USDA Departmental Common Controls. The agencies should make any of these controls hybrid if they have additional policy or procedures that are pertinent.o \u201cDash-1\u201d controls -- the first control of each control family \u2013 address Departmental policies and Agency procedures. The Dash-1 controls should be hybrid with the Department-level implementations offered by USDA Departmental Common Controls. The Department is responsible for the creation of the policies pertaining to the controls. The agencies are responsible for all control procedures, unless otherwise specified by the Department. Agencies may create policies that exceed the baseline guidance published by the Department but must follow Departmental policy. CA-1 should be inherited from the Departmental Common Controls in its entirety, because the Department issues the policy and the procedures.Common controls are selected and assigned in CSAM. As agencies update the systems with the proper inheritance, issues may arise where a control implementation that is required to be inherited from a program/system cannot be. These controls should be made \"Not Applicable\" in CSAM. When making the control not applicable, enter the complete explanation of the inheritance (what is inherited and from what system is it inherited from) as the justification.5.8 Tailoring Remaining Controls and Document in CSAM Once the selection of common controls is accomplished, evaluate the remaining controls to determine which will be hybrid and which will be system specific. This is also a good opportunity to look at controls that are not applicable. Not-applicable controls must have a valid reason/justification explaining why they are not applicable. An example is the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) control. This could be designated as not applicable because the system does not contain or use VoIP. Once the decisions have been made as to what controls the system must implement, a strategy for continuous monitoring of the controls must be developed and any required changes to the control tailoring must be made. For a new system that has never been through the process, the Authorizing Official (AO) will approve 11the security plan at this point. This approval designates those controls that must be implemented by the system. Most systems at USDA are operational with controls in place, therefore steps 1 through 3 have already been accomplished. For these systems, the SSP and associated documentation must be reviewed/updated annually by the system owner. This is covered in Section 2.8.5.9 Develop a Strategy for Monitoring the Controls The Department establishes the criteria for selecting security controls to be monitored (post deployment) and determines the frequency of the monitoring for Key and annual sets of controls. The Department has established the monitoring criteria and frequency for all controls in the Department. (See Appendix E for the list of controls and the year of their assessment). The agency can monitor controls more frequently but cannot monitor them less frequently. All control assessments for moderate/high categorized systems must be accomplished by an independent assessor. The owner(s) of any controls inherited by the system is responsible for the annual assessment of those controls and the system will inherit the result.", "chunk_id": 22}, {"chunk": "5.10 RMF Step 2 Completion Summary---In the \u201cAssessments \u2013 Control Management\u201d section of CSAM, ensure the NIST Version is set to NIST SP 800-53 Rev4 (or latest Version) and the \u201cControls on prior Control Sets\u201d field value is zero (0).

Be clear and address all aspects of the control. Use a 12-point Times New Roman Font. If the control has an A, B, and C, then the implementation should have an A, B, and C, followed by the implementation of each aspect of the control. This makes it easier for the security controls assessor and the concurrence review team to ensure that each aspect of a control is properly addressed and implemented. It is best to consider the NIST SP 800-1253 control to be a statement of policy and the implementation a write-up of exactly how the program/system implements that statement of policy. Therefore, it is unnecessary to quote policy in the implementation.5.13 RMF Step 3.2: Update the SSP Once all of the security controls are complete with implementations entered, generate the security plan in CSAM. Once generated, review the plan, checking to be sure that control implementations have indeed been entered into CSAM. Conduct a search of the plan for any blank fields. There should be no blank fields within the SSP; every field should have something entered. If not, go back to the control implementation and determine why the field is blank.5.14 RMF Step 3.3: Finalize the CP, CMP and IRP It is at this step that all the documents need to be updated to reflect the current state/implementation of the system. If the system is covered by an organizational CMP and IRP, then ensure these inherited documents contain specific references to the system. The CP should be finalized along with the CP test plan, training and CP test results. Specified inherited documentation should be specifically referenced as to their location, while system specific documentation should be loaded in CSAM to their Appendix locations following the guidance of Section 3.1.

The user submits an email to the concurrence review team at cscc@ocio.usda.gov stating the package is ready for review in CSAM. This concurrence review is primarily for the security plan and the categorization; however, the supporting documents (CP, CMP, ISA, PTA, and/or PIA) that are present at the time of the review will also be considered. If the concurrence review team finds any issues with the documentation, they will notate the issues in the concurrence review checklists and return the checklists to the agency. The key items for the RMF Step 3 review are the system categorization and the security plan. Since issues with the remaining documents do not have a significant effect on testing, they can be addressed simultaneously with the performance of RMF Step 4 testing.The result of the concurrence review is either passage of the system to RMF Step 4 (Assess Security Controls), or the documentation is returned for further refinement with a checklist of items to remediate. Agencies cannot proceed to RMF Step 4 until notified via concur memo that the system has successfully completed the RMF Step 3b concurrence review.
