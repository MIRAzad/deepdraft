Background---The Office of Global Policy and Strategy (OGPS, the Office) serves as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA\u2019s, the Agency\u2019s) international office. It is led by the Associate Commissioner for Global Policy and Strategy (ACGPS), who provides vision, leadership, and strategy, and is supported by offices at the FDA Headquarters and Foreign Offices, strategically placed around the globe, in Europe (Belgium and Amsterdam), India, China, and Latin America (Mexico, Costa Rica, and Chile).OGPS maintains equipment, systems, and information management requirements at the 7 Foreign Offices for approximately 80 individuals who regularly represent FDA to other governments, national regulatory partners, facilities, and partners within the United States Government. Providing IT and information management support is complex as performing the work of the office requires management of physical assets (laptops, etc.) and digital tools and systems (enterprise- or office-level) for the headquarters location and for the foreign offices. In addition, there are legacy documentation, records, and reference materials from the previous Office of International Programs that exist alongside current materials andsystems. Responsibility for this maintenance lies with the Office of Global Diplomacy and Partnerships (OGDP) Program Support Team (PST). The OGDP PST is also responsible for managing the overall IT portfolio, which includes contracts for information technology systems, project management, systems management, liaising with the Office of Information Management and Technology (OIMT), OC IT Liaison, and International Help Desk.Information technology and management decisions for OGPS must be made with consideration of other stakeholder requirements, those of the FDA Office of Information Management and Technology (OIMT) and in some cases US State Department. OIMT defines FDA-standard computer images, software, and collaboration tools and maintains the FDA Helpdesk function for local and remote personnel. OIMT approves and facilitates software downloads and maintains shared space for applications such as Salesforce. OIMT also maintains a shared/centralized procurement process for some software, license, and hardware purchases across FDA. All IT-related actions taken by OGPS that affect individual or collective settings, software, or access must be in accordance with OIMT standards. OGPS must also stand ready to adapt and adjust to changes to the FDA IT environment initiated under OIMT. In 2020 and 2021, for example, FDA began a migration from SharePoint 2010 to SharePoint online, moved the Agency to Office 365, introduced Microsoft Teams, and retired the familiar communication tool, Skype.OGPS personnel perform work within multiple software systems and applications, and IT security and support requirements differ across the multiple geographic locations. Primary digital tools for collaboration across the Offices include SharePoint Online (following a 2020 migration from SharePoint 2010), Office 365, MS Teams, One Drive, network drives, Zoom, and email. Given legacy file structures and systems and current needs and tools, management, and maintenance of the OGPS IT infrastructure1 require technical and program/project management support.The current OGPS information technology infrastructure and requirements provide the tools the personnel need to perform their work with a combination of hardware, software, and support personnel. However, OGPS recognizes that there are opportunities for refinement and improvement of the current IT infrastructure. In 2020, OGPS leadership approved the following Mission, Vision, and Goals as part of its IT Management Strategic Plan:OGPS IT Mission Statement: \u201cTo manage an IT portfolio by providing high quality IT services,unified around central goals that efficiently address OGPS business needs.\u201dOGPS IT Vision Statement: \u201cTo provide an OGPS IT portfolio that manages and aligns technologies, improves customer service, safeguards data and information, and continuously enhances the user experience.\u201dTo realize this vision and achieve its mission, OGPS IT is pursuing the following goals, with the focus of this acquisition supporting Goals 2, 3, 4 and 5.Goal 1: Optimize IT Workforce \u2013 Ensuring that each task spanning across the OGPS IT portfolio has sustained and capable resources with requisite training and development to promote continuity and efficiency of operations.Goal 2: Provide Innovative IT Capabilities \u2013 Evaluating the OGPS IT portfolio against agency- selected IT technologies and innovations to ensure early adoption of best practices and better cater to customer needs.Goal 3: Provide Efficient IT Services \u2013 Collaborating effectively with various FDA and external stakeholders to provide IT services, capitalize on shared efficiencies, and align with end user needs.1Goal 4: Increase System Usability \u2013 Maintaining the functionality and ease of use for systems utilized to execute IT processes and exploring opportunities for automation where applicable; andGoal 5: Align IT Management \u2013 Aligning the OGPS IT portfolio along a singular IT strategy and vision at every level of operation and establishing a unified framework for IT decisions to be made in accordance with informed budgetary allocations.Per Goal 5, OGPS is moving to an IT management and acquisition strategy that will combine and integrate services if possible; sunset duplicative or outdated software and systems; identify needs for new solutions; and develop an acquisition and long-term management plan for technology, people, and systems.", "chunk_id": 2, "page_no": 3}, {"chunk": "2. Statement of Work---The infrastructure is defined as applications, software, user processes, and other systems that support information management, transfer, sharing, and storage.

These contractor employees go through visitor screening each day and must be escorted at all time while in DHHS-owned or leased space.2. GENERAL - The Contractor shall submit the following items to the Contracting Officer\u2019s Representative (COR), within five (5) business days of commencement of work under this contract:A roster of contractor employee names, identifying Key Personnel and Tier designation(s);Confirmation all individual employee security information has been submitted properly; and\"Contractor's Commitment to Protect Non-public Information Agreement\" forms signed by each employee named in the roster.Pursuant to HSPD-12, the Contractor shall advise its prospective employees about the security and background requirements stated hereinFor any individual who does not obtain a favorable background investigation he/she must cease work on the contract immediately.If a Contractor employee changes job responsibilities under this contract, the Contractor shall notify the COR, and the Government will make a determination whether an additional security clearance is required.In the event there are any proposed personnel changes in the Contractor\u2019s staffing roster previously submitted to the COR, the Contractor must submit an updated roster to the COR, along with a brief explanation for the change. In turn, the COR will initiate the procedures stated herein to ensure any new contractor employees obtain a PIV card in a timely manner \u2013 prior to that individual commencing work under the contract.Note: If the proposed personnel change is for a position designated Key Personnel under the contract, a complete justification \u2013 along with a resume or curriculum vitae \u2013 must be submitted to the Contracting Officer and COR for review and approval. If approved, the Contracting Officer will execute a Contract Modification prior to that individual commencing work under the contract.BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS - With the exception of costs associated with 3. fingerprinting Contractor employees outside of the FDA Personnel Security Office, the Government will conduct all required background investigations at no cost to the Contractor. The cost of fingerprinting Contractor employees at any location other than the FDA Personnel Security Office will be borne by the Contractor.
