The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester\u2019s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the government. The agency\u2019s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.

As used in this clause\u2014 \u201cPersonally Identifiable Information (PII)\u201d means information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, or biometric records, either alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, or mother\u2019s maiden name. The definition of PII is not anchored to any single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified. In performing this assessment, it is important for an agency to recognize that non-personally identifiable information can become personally identifiable information whenever additional information is made publicly available\u2014in any medium and from any source\u2014that, combined with other available information, could be used to identify an individual. PII is a subset of sensitive information. Examples of PII include, but are not limited to: name, date of birth, mailing address, telephone number, Social Security number (SSN), email address, zip code, account numbers, certificate/license numbers, vehicle identifiers including license plates, uniform resource locators (URLs), static Internet protocol addresses, biometric identifiers such as fingerprint, voiceprint, iris scan, photographic facial images, or any other unique identifying number or characteristic, and any information where it is reasonably foreseeable that the information will be linked with other information to identify the individual. \u201cSensitive Information\u201d is defined in HSAR clause 3052.204-71, Contractor Employee Access, as any information, which if lost, misused, disclosed, or, without authorization is accessed, or modified, could adversely affect the national or homeland security interest, the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under section 552a of Title 5, United States Code (the Privacy Act), but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense, homeland security or foreign policy. This definition includes the following categories of information: (1) Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) as set out in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (Title II, Subtitle B, of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, 196 Stat. 2135), as amended, the implementing regulations thereto (Title 6, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 29) as amended, the applicable PCII Procedures Manual, as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the PCII Program Manager or his/her designee); (2) Sensitive Security Information (SSI), as defined in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1520, as amended, \u201cPolicies and Procedures of Safeguarding and Control of SSI,\u201d as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration or his/her designee); (3) Information designated as \u201cFor Official Use Only,\u201d which is unclassified information of a sensitive nature and the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely impact a person\u2019s privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, or other programs or operations essential to the national or homeland security interest; and (4) Any information that is designated \u201csensitive\u201d or subject to other controls, safeguards or protections in accordance with subsequently adopted homeland security information handling procedures. \u201cSensitive Information Incident\u201d is an incident that includes the known, potential, or suspected exposure, loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access or attempted access of any Government system, Contractor system, or sensitive information. \u201cSensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII)\u201d is a subset of PII, which if lost, compromised or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. Some forms of PII are sensitive as stand-alone elements. Examples of such PII include: Social Security numbers (SSN), driver\u2019s license or state identification number, Alien Registration Numbers (A-number), financial account number, and biometric identifiers such as fingerprint, voiceprint, or iris scan. Additional examples include any groupings of information that contain an individual\u2019s name or other unique identifier plus one or more of the following elements: (1) Truncated SSN (such as last 4 digits) (2) Date of birth (month, day, and year)", "chunk_id": 22, "page_no": 18}, {"chunk": "RFP: 70Z04424RESIAB01---18(3) Citizenship or immigration status (4) Ethnic or religious affiliation (5) Sexual orientation (6) Criminal History (7) Medical Information (8) System authentication information such as mother\u2019s maiden name, account passwords or personal identification numbers (PIN) Other PII may be \u201csensitive\u201d depending on its context, such as a list of employees and their performance ratings or an unlisted home address or phone number.

Contractor compliance with this clause, as well as the policies and procedures described below, is required. (1) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policies and procedures on Contractor personnel security requirements are set forth in various Management Directives (MDs), Directives, and Instructions. MD 11042.1, Safeguarding Sensitive But Unclassified (For Official Use Only) Information describes how Contractors must handle sensitive but unclassified information. DHS uses the term \u201cFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\u201d to identify sensitive but unclassified information that is not otherwise categorized by statute or regulation. Examples of sensitive information that are categorized by statute or regulation are PCII, SSI, etc. The DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A and the DHS 4300A Sensitive Systems Handbook provide the policies and procedures on security for Information Technology (IT) resources. The DHS Handbook for Safeguarding Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information provides guidelines to help safeguard SPII in both paper and electronic form.

(3) All Contractor employees with access to sensitive information shall execute DHS Form 11000-6, Department of Homeland Security Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), as a condition of access to such information. The Contractor shall maintain signed copies of the NDA for all employees as a record of compliance. The Contractor shall provide copies of the signed NDA to the Contracting Officer\u2019s Representative (COR) no later than two (2) days after execution of the form.

Unless otherwise specified in the ATO letter, the ATO is valid for three (3) years. The Contractor shall adhere to current Government policies, procedures, and guidance for the Security Authorization (SA) process as defined below. (1) Complete the Security Authorization process. The SA process shall proceed according to the DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A (Version 11.0, April 30, 2014), or any successor publication, DHS 4300A Sensitive Systems Handbook (Version 9.1, July 24, 2012), or any successor publication, and the Security Authorization Process Guide including templates. (i) Security Authorization Process Documentation. SA documentation shall be developed using the Government provided Requirements Traceability Matrix and Government security documentation templates. SA documentation consists of the following: Security Plan, Contingency Plan, Contingency Plan Test Results, Configuration Management Plan, Security Assessment Plan, Security Assessment Report, and Authorization to Operate Letter. Additional documents that may be required include a Plan(s) of Action and Milestones and Interconnection Security Agreement(s). During the development of SA documentation, the Contractor shall submit a signed SA package, validated by an independent third party, to the COR for acceptance by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of operation of the IT system. The Government is the final authority on the compliance of the SA package and may limit the number of resubmissions of a modified SA package. Once the ATO has been accepted by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, the Contracting Officer shall incorporate the ATO into the contract as a compliance document. The Government\u2019s acceptance of the ATO does not alleviate the Contractor\u2019s responsibility to ensure the IT system controls are implemented and operating effectively. (ii) Independent Assessment. Contractors shall have an independent third party validate the security and privacy controls in place for the system(s). The independent third party shall review and analyze the SA package, and report on technical, operational, and management level deficiencies as outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-53 Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. The Contractor shall address all deficiencies before submitting the SA package to the Government for acceptance. (iii) Support the completion of the Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) as needed. As part of the SA process, the Contractor may be required to support the Government in the completion of the PTA. The requirement to complete a PTA is triggered by the creation, use, modification, upgrade, or disposition of a Contractor IT system that will store, maintain and use PII, and must be renewed at least every three (3) years. Upon review of the PTA, the DHS Privacy Office determines whether a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and/or Privacy Act System of Records Notice (SORN), or modifications thereto, are required. The Contractor shall provide all support necessary to assist the Department in completing the PIA in a timely manner and shall ensure that project management plans and schedules include time for the completion of the PTA, PIA, and SORN (to the extent required) as milestones. Support in this context includes responding timely to requests for information from the Government about the use, access, storage, and maintenance of PII on the Contractor\u2019s system, and providing timely review of relevant compliance documents for factual accuracy. Information on the DHS privacy compliance process, including PTAs, PIAs, and SORNs, is accessible at http://www.dhs.gov/privacy- compliance. (2) Renewal of ATO. Unless otherwise specified in the ATO letter, the ATO shall be renewed every three (3) years. The Contractor is required to update its SA package as part of the ATO renewal process. The Contractor shall update its SA package by one of the following methods: (1) Updating the SA documentation in the DHS automated information assurance tool for acceptance by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, at least 90 days before the ATO expiration date for review and verification of security controls; or (2) Submitting an updated SA package directly to the COR for approval by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, at least 90 days before the ATO expiration date for review and verification of security controls. The 90 day review process is independent of the system production date and therefore it is important that the Contractor build the review into project schedules. The reviews may include onsite visits that involve physical or logical inspection of the Contractor environment to ensure controls are in place.", "chunk_id": 24, "page_no": 20}, {"chunk": "RFP: 70Z04424RESIAB01---20(3) Security Review.

In the event of a sensitive information incident, the Government may suspend or revoke an existing ATO (either in part or in whole). If an ATO is suspended or revoked in accordance with this provision, the Contracting Officer may direct the Contractor to take additional security measures to secure sensitive information. These measures may include restricting access to sensitive information on the Contractor IT system under this contract. Restricting access may include disconnecting the system processing, storing, or transmitting the sensitive information from the Internet or other networks or applying additional security controls. (6) Federal Reporting Requirements. Contractors operating information systems on behalf of the Government or operating systems containing sensitive information shall comply with Federal reporting requirements. Annual and quarterly data collection will be coordinated by the Government. Contractors shall provide the COR with requested information within three (3) business days of receipt of the request.
