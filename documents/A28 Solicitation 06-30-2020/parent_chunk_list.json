DEA has a presence in more than 350 domestic offices in 26 divisions within the U.S. and 75 foreign offices. DEA\u2019s operation and support activities are distributed across five core business lines that include the following:\u2022 Forensic \u2022 Financial \u2022 Intelligence \u2022 Administration", "chunk_id": 4}, {"chunk": "Investigative---The core business lines require significant Information Technology (IT) resources to carry out key processes. In support of the DEA mission, these IT services include developing, deploying, and maintaining DEA\u2019s mission critical and business applications as well as their supporting infrastructure.3.2 BACKGROUND---The Office of Information Systems (TC) is the major, central source of software development and data management for DEA\u2019s mission critical applications. The Software Operations and Data Management Section (TGR) within TC manages the development, maintenance, and major enhancements of applications and DEA\u2019s data standardization and warehouse using the agile software methodology. TGR provides supporting estimates and schedules and coordinates resources to successfully complete the project and manage the project scope. TGR ensures communication/use of standard practices of the agile software methodology, software configuration standards, functional testing standards, and data management best practices.The TC established a de-facto \u201cConcorde\u201d standard in 2010 when DEA\u2019s core case management application was developed as the first of the Concorde web applications with single sign on and zero footprint. Over the following couple years, TC established a data warehouse, Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) that provides integrated data store for Concorde application data and other DEA applications data as well as enterprise level reports. In addition, a Search application was developed using Concorde standards to provide access to the data that resides inside the EDW as well as other data sources/stores throughout DEA which provides the users a central way to search data.12RFQ No. 15DDHQ20Q00000057 P00001Concorde is a business-driven IT program providing unified access to, and the sharing of information in accordance with, the DEA mission and the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) strategic plan. The concept of the Concorde Program is to eliminate stove-piped systems by integrating business functions and allowing for information sharing across the five main DEA business layers. Concorde\u2019s current technical architecture, founded in 2010, is multi-tiered and implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern using elements of the Microsoft ASP.NET 4.0 MVC framework. Some of the code that implements views is written in JavaScript and specifically the jQuery JavaScript library. Concorde is delivered to and runs within the Internet Explorer 10 browser on the user\u2019s workstation. Concorde applications, including Search, other Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) applications and EDW are hosted on DEA\u2019s SBU Firebird network.As technology advances, DEA applications must maintain pace to leverage faster, more secure technological upgrades. Microsoft has released a substantial update to the .NET technology stack called .NET Core. This update is faster, more secure, and has a smaller footprint. It opens the door for enhanced future integration with both mobile and cloud technologies and provides for better interoperability options for Concorde to communicate with other Law Enforcement software systems. Concorde has begun the rewrite of DEA\u2019s primary application to.NET Core. To leverage the upgrades of .NET Core and the .NET standard libraries, all existing Concorde applications, including Search 2.0, will require the modernization effort.Integral to the architecture of the EDW, is DEA\u2019s adoption of dimensional modeling to provide a standard, intuitive framework that allows for high performance access, using Fact and Dimension tables. The DEA EDW is based upon a Kimball data warehouse strategy. The EDW team is responsible for ingesting hundreds of new tables each year for reporting purposes and is currently over 11TB warehouse. Key to this dimensional analysis and data modeling is ensuring that data is not duplicated in the various content areas of the EDW.The EDW team follows the Agile Scrum methodology to maintain the databases and generate scripts to load and retrieve data content. EDW support incorporates both data warehouse maintenance, reporting services, and data lakes as needed.Since December of 2015, Concorde Search has evolved from Solr to SolrCloud as an augmentation to the core structure to an architecture where ElasticSearch is now a core technology. ElasticSearch is now in production with approximately 10 servers dedicated to this search functionality. Elastic Search production was released on April 2018, and is currently used for search capabilities of over one billion records of information that provide blended search results from more than seven core content areas. These complex search indexes must be maintained and kept current at both the Sterling Park Technology Park (SPTC) facility and remotely at the DEA Alternate Computing Facility (ACF) currently located in West Virginia and in Dallas, TX or another location in the future.Additionally, to support DEA mission from an investigative, intelligence, and management reporting, TGR is looking into advancing our data analytics platform past our current canned SQL Server Reporting Service (SSRS) reports. In October 2018, TGR rolled out PowerBI on the desktop and server for DEA users to use for self-analysis as they needed to while we have13RFQ No. 15DDHQ20Q00000057 P00001created additional interactive PowerBI reports for consumption by all levels of the organization while reading data directly from EDW. Also, DEA is pushing forward to utilize capabilities that come with Elastic Search X-Pack software as well as integration into IBMs I2 software and possibly other analytical tools as we determine additional needs.Regardless of effort, development teams follow the Agile Software Development Methodology to build and deliver high quality software. Currently, Agile SCRUM teams develop new Concorde functionality, and provide operations and maintenance support to existing Concorde Search application and EDW databases. As technology advances, DEA applications must maintain pace to leverage faster, more secure technological upgrades.3.3 OBJECTIVE The objective of this effort is to continue to develop and deliver quality data management, reporting / dashboards and search / analytic application/functionalities in the Concorde framework, provide operations and maintenance support to existing databases and application, increase efficiencies across teams regarding data management, and expedite the delivery of search and analytical capabilities. Acceptable quality will be identified once databases, search and analytical tools are tested by developers, independently unit tested by a contractor tester or business analyst, and tested and approved by the Government Product Owner. Additional acceptance will be conducted after demonstrations to the customer, if applicable, and further deployed to a beta environment. Upon successful testing, these capabilities will be deployed into a production environment.The EDW support will include both data warehouse maintenance, reporting services, and data lakes, as necessary. The EDW contains consolidated data from internal and external sources. Some data is stored in a Kimball-style data warehouse with dimension and fact tables while others are maintained in SQL databases for specific reporting needs. It is used as the primary source of all DEA enterprise reporting as well as data sharing platform internally and externally for the agency.The EDW team follows the Agile Scrum methodology to maintain the databases and generate scripts to load and retrieve data content. EDW support incorporates both data warehouse maintenance, enterprise reporting services via PowerBI, SSRS reporting, and other reporting / analytical tools as determined by the government and continues to add business intelligence capabilities to support customer data self-service efforts via PowerBI.In April of 2018, Concorde deployed the first phase to modernize search capabilities from SolrCloud to ElasticSearch with a newly envisioned user interface and a new data ingest method. ElasticSearch is now providing search to the core Concorde areas and continues to move forward for a full replacement of the legacy Search and adding searching capabilities for other DEA data sets. Search is adding business intelligence and analytical capabilities to support intelligence and enforcement efforts for DEA.The Contractor shall maintain, enhance, and design the Elastic Search application by providing search capabilities that blend search results from multiple sources, API capabilities for external14RFQ No. 15DDHQ20Q00000057 P00001applications and business intelligence capabilities via custom development, XPack (Kibana, Graph, etc.) and possible other Custom Off The Shelf (COTS) products. These complex search indexes must be maintained and kept current at both the Sterling Park Technology Park facility and remotely at the DEA Alternate Computing Facility (ACF) currently located in West Virginia and in Dallas, TX or another location in the future.If, at the discretion of the Government, a different search engine/functionality is deemed more advantageous, the Contractor would provide the same level of support as defined for Elastic Search.The Contractor shall provide development teams that will focus on EDW efforts and separate Search / analytical team(s) to maintain and enhance the current system while create, developing a larger analytical platform for DEA.

DISQUALIFYING FACTORS---Issues may surface concerning security approval or retention of a Contractor\u2019s applicant or employee that are not addressed in this contract. If there is any doubt regarding the suitability of an applicant or employee, the individual will not be approved for assignment to this or any DEA contract.Suitability is a requirement for employment on a DEA contract as it concerns an individual\u2019s conduct, character, reputation, reliability, trustworthiness and/or loyalty to the United States. To be suitable, an individual\u2019s assignment or continued assignment on a DEA contract must be reasonably expected to accomplish DEA\u2019s mission.Any one or more of the following factors\u2014as disclosed on the SF-86, in a personal interview with the applicant, or as part of the background investigation\u2014are grounds for mandatory disqualification for assignment on a DEA contract and from further consideration for any type of assignment or employment involving DEA. The Contractor is responsible for interviewing each applicant and reviewing the complete clearance package using the following criteria. If relevant mandatory disqualification information is obtained, the requested package should not be submitted to DEA until the disqualifying information is favorably mitigated.A. CRIMINAL RECORD:1. 2. 3.conviction resulting from a felony charge(s), regardless of when the conviction occurred; multiple misdemeanor convictions, regardless of when the convictions occurred; one or more arrests and/or misdemeanor convictions for possession of an illegal drug(s) or for being under the influence of an illegal drug(s); pending indictments or pending criminal charges, regardless of whether the charge(s) is a felony or misdemeanor; and/or currently serving a period of probation resulting from a criminal conviction, regardless of whether the conviction is for a felony or a misdemeanor charge.4.5.78RFQ No. 15DDHQ20Q00000057 P00001B. ILLEGAL DRUG USE:DEA\u2019s mission is to enforce the Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 801 et seq. The illegal use of drugs by any of its personnel, including contractor personnel, may adversely affect the performance of its mission, create a danger to the public safety, expose the agency to civil liability, jeopardize criminal investigations and prosecutions, lead to corruption, or undermine public confidence. Because of its law enforcement responsibilities and the sensitive nature of its work, DEA has a compelling obligation to ensure a workplace that is free of illegal drugs.Applicants who are found, through investigation or personal admission, to have experimented with or used narcotics or dangerous drugs, except those medically prescribed, may be disqualified for employment on a DEA contract. Disclosed drug use will be decided on a case-by-case basis. Experimental use or use of any narcotic or dangerous drug, including marijuana, after employment on a DEA contract is cause for removal.C. FALSE STATEMENTS:A false statement is the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form or interview used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, such as:1. 2. 3.altering the condition of discharge on military documents; altering college transcripts; falsely completing or failing to disclose information on the SF-86 or any other documents used in the background investigation process; and/or conflicting statements of drug use, either on the SF-86 on the Drug Use Statement, or during the background investigation.4.D. DEBT-RELATED ISSUES:Debt-related issues are the most prevalent derogatory issues found during background investigations and cause delays in the adjudication process. The Contractor is encouraged to obtain the applicant/employee\u2019s credit report and have all potentially disqualifying issues mitigated prior to submitting the requested applicant package to DEA for processing.The terms indebtedness, delinquent debt, and debt related issues mean lawful financial obligations that are just debts that are past due. Debt related issues raise a number of suitability and security concerns that an individual must satisfactorily resolve before an affirmative adjudicative decision can be made. Each applicant\u2019s indebtedness will be reviewed on an individual basis. Court imposed judgments, defaulted student loans, and other delinquent financial obligations imposed by law (e.g., child support payments, Federal, state, or local taxes) are matters of serious concern. The mandatory disqualification policy applies to those applicants who cannot satisfactorily document their efforts to repay student loans or to pay child support, taxes, or judgments.In order to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1681, et seq.) the Contractor must carefully adhere to the following guidelines. The Contractor must obtain a credit report for accounts in the applicant/employee\u2019s name only. Do not obtain a credit report for joint accounts This will be a \u201cpersonal report for employment purposes.\u201dThe Contractor shall provide a written notice/release to the applicant/employee that a credit report may be used for employment purposes. The applicant/employee shall sign and date the notice/release and provide it to the Contractor before the credit report is obtained by the Contractor. The Contractor is not authorized to obtain a credit report prior to receipt of the signed notice/release.79RFQ No. 15DDHQ20Q00000057 P00001The Contractor shall not take adverse action against the applicant/employee based in whole or in part upon the credit report, without first providing the applicant/employee a copy of the credit report and a written description of the applicant/employee\u2019s rights as described under Section 1681g of Title 15 U.S.C.If a potentially disqualifying debt-related issue surfaces that the applicant/employee omitted from the SF-86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions, the requested forms should not be submitted to DEA unless the applicant/employee can provide mitigating information that clearly explains the omission and how the issue will be satisfactorily resolved.E. ALLEGIANCE TO THE UNITED STATES:Evidence of activities developed during the background investigation that would bring the applicant\u2019s allegiance to the United States into question, such as:1.involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, sedition, or other act whose aim is to overthrow the Government of the United States or alter the form of government by unconstitutional means; and/or2.", "chunk_id": 81}, {"chunk": "foreign influence or preference.---F.
