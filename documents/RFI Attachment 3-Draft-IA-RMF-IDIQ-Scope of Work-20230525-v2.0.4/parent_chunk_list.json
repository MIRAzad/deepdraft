An \u201cinformation system\u201d is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information [44 USC 3502].The USCG further categorizes \u201cinformation system\u201d by type, such as Platform Information Technology (PIT), PIT System, and Operational Technology (OT). Examples of USCG information systems include, but are not limited to computing systems; cyber-physical systems; industrial/process control systems; environmental control systems; Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA); Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC); weapons systems; command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and navigation systems; motor/engine controls; power generation systems; power distribution systems; propulsion control systems; devices and information technology products such as smart phones and tablets; and embedded devices/sensors. For the purposes of this document, the term \u201cinformation system\u201d or \u201csystem\u201d refers to any type categorization descriptor used in practice by the USCG, and includes systems connected to the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), systems deployed in commercial cloud environments, and off-network systems.\u201cCybersecurity\u201d (which replaced the term Information Assurance [IA]) is defined as prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37, Risk Management Framework (RMF) for Information Systems and Organizations, provides a system lifecycle approach for security and privacy, and is integral to the implementation of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (2014). The RMF is mandatory for federal government use, and promotes near real- time risk management and ongoing information system authorization through the implementation of continuous monitoring processes; provides senior leaders the necessary information to make cost-effective, risk-based decisions with regard to the information systems supporting their core missions and business functions; and integrates cybersecurity into the enterprise architecture and system development life cycle. The seven step process of the RMF includes preparation, categorization, selection, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring.The USCG requires contractor support to perform the RMF tasks that are the responsibility of the Information System Security Officer, Information System Security Engineer, and the Security Control Assessor, to also include cybersecurity compliance assessment, management, and reporting for the USCG systems. The services provided by these roles are required to properly implement the RMF and are applicable to the system from time of acquisition through decommissioning and disposal. In the past, these standard RMF services have been provided through several disparate contracts. The desire is to consolidate these contracted RMF services under a single contract. This organizational approach to acquire these standard cybersecurity services will align contracting activities, reduce the contract management overhead, and allow for greater efficiency to award new work when warranted.", "chunk_id": 1, "page_no": 2}, {"chunk": "Scope of Work \u2013 RMF Support Services v2.0.4, 25 May 2023---PAGE 2/26---Scope of Work IDIQ Contract: xxxx---1.2 SCOPE---This Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is established for Contractor provided cybersecurity Risk Management Framework (RMF) services for USCG systems.
