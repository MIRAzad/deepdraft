GENERAL: This is a non-personnel services contract to provide cyber security capabilities services to support the Director, Deputy Commandant Information (DC I), Information, Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (IC4). The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein. Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government.1.1 Introduction: The contractor shall provide the best approach, supervision, non- personal services, and other items related to and necessary to perform cyber security capabilities to support the DC IC4 as defined in this Statement of Objectives.1.2 Purpose: The purpose of this contract action is to provide cyber security capabilities services to support the Director, IC4. The contractor shall detect the strengths and risks associated with the current state of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN), systems, applications, software and data through review, analysis, risk assessment, and mitigation recommendations.1.3 Background: The Marine Corps is committed to pursuing all necessary and prudent steps to ensure that Marine Corps communications and information technology are available to support Marines and civilian Marines, serving in both deployed and garrison environments, without compromising communications.Without exception, the goal of the Director of the Command, Control, Communications and Computers (IC4) is to securely supply the right information, to the right place, supported by highly skilled personnel delivering power to the edge from the garrison to the tactical end-of-the-wire for today\u2019s Marine. The Director, IC4/Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for the development and oversight of policy, plans and guidance of enterprise services and the security of those services. The Director is also responsible for planning, directing, coordinating, and overseeing IC4 and Information Technology (IT) capabilities and defining policy that supports the warfighting and garrison communications functions for the Marine Corps. As the Cybersecurity (CY) portfolio manager for the Marine Corps component of the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN), the Director, IC4 is the executive agent responsible for planning, directing, coordinating, and overseeing cybersecurity capabilities and defining policy that support the war fighting and garrison communications functions for the Marine Corps.Specifically, IC4 is responsible for policy oversight and direction of information systems standards, information systems integration internal and external to the Marine Corps, and monitoring IC4 systems development and implementation. This responsibility also applies to DoD, national, and allied systems that impact the Marine Corps Information Technology architecture and corporate enterprise network application. As the manager of the Marine Corps component of the DODIN CY Portfolio, the Director manages, oversees, and directs the DODIN Information Assurance (IA) Capability Areas as defined by the DODIN CY Intelligence Community Directive (ICD), dated 2005., e.g., Defense of the DODIN, Assured Information Sharing, Provide Information Integrity & Non- Repudiation, Assured Mission Management, Information Confidentiality, Ensure a Highly Available Enterprise.The threat to the Marine Corps systems infrastructure has changed and increased considerably. The total number of vulnerabilities identified annually in operating systems and applications continues to grow. Additionally, the timetable for the hacker community to develop exploitation tools to exploit vulnerabilities has decreased from weeks to days, and often mere hours after vulnerability is known. As a result, the network defense game has changed. The Director, IC4 requires support for independent cybersecurity assessments, risk mitigation and remediation plans, Certification and Authorization (C&A), and Communication Security (COMSEC) efforts.DoD has fielded vulnerability scanning, monitoring, vulnerability remediation and patch management tools to support both unscheduled and formal readiness assessments. The contractor shall assist the Government in ensuring the application and compliance of these DoD provided tools to Marine Corps Cyberspace defense framework by conducting assessments, analyzing results, recommending remediation actions, and reporting the security configuration efforts through the Department of Navy (DON) to Congress.Information systems that are vital to the Marine Corps\u2019 ability to carry out their mission are targets for our adversaries. DC I IC4, Compliance (ICC) Cybersecurity (CY) Branch is tasked with the responsibility to coordinate Marine Corps wide efforts to safeguard thenetwork from attack and preserve our ability to provide reliable and effective network services. Policy for cybersecurity implementation rests with DC I IC4. The focus of cybersecurity in the Marine Corps is to ensure policies and procedures are implemented through tasks, standards, conditions, and oversight, to guarantee assured information delivery, assured data integrity, and assured information protection.IC4\u2019s Cybersecurity Team must develop, oversee, and implement cybersecurity policy on all information technology (IT) resources procured, developed, operated, maintained, or managed throughout the Marine Corps. The Branch is also responsible to defend the MCEN through a defense-in-depth strategy that, in coordination with the DON, the Joint Community, Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Marine Forces Cyberspace Command (MARFORCYBER), and the Marine Corps networked domains to achieve strong, effective, and ensure multidimensional protection of our IT environment.DoD requires all information systems, networks, and applications be reviewed for cybersecurity compliance and lifecycle management. The Marine Corps has enterprise- level system accreditations covering Marine Corps networked domains, e.g., the Marine Corps Community of Interest (COI), the Marine Corps Enterprise Network Non- Classified Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (MCEN-N), and the Secret IP Router Network (MCEN-S). Service aggregation and system accreditations are connected to the DODIN through these enterprise-level accreditations. The Authorizing Official (AO) requires support for review of authorization packages using the Risk Management Framework (RFM) to ensure cybersecurity compliance. The contractor shall assist the Government in daily management of submitted C&A package review and recommendation processing; and drafting policy, guidance, manuals, and training curriculum.The Marine Corps COMSEC Program support requirement provides assistance in generation and propagation of policy, guidance, account management, training, and programmatic oversight of secure communications for voice, data, and imagery. This is all in support of the Intelligence Program and Marine Warfighting requirements. The contractor shall assist the Government in daily management of the Marine Corps COMSEC accounts, cryptographic equipment logistics, and account training. Provide status reports on a scheduled basis citing statuses for both legacy Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) and transitioning Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) suites.1.4 Scope: DC I IC4 requires service to support cybersecurity capability deliverables, including Risk Management Framework (RMF) Authorization and Assessment and Authorization (C&A), cyberspace defense, and Communications Security (COMSEC) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) management efforts. RMF C&A capability provides the overall management and execution of actions for support to the Authorizing Official (AO) and Security Controls Assessor (SCA) in the final steps of the process as directed by federal law, Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Navy (DON), and Marine Corps policy and directives. Cyberspace defense specialized support capability provides independent active assessment, defense and response to cyber incidents asdirected by DOD, DON, and Marine Corps. COMSEC KMI management capability supports the accounting and management of special cryptographic devices as directed by the National Security Agency (NSA). Capabilities range the Marine Corps enterprise, spanning tactical, garrison, legacy, and cloud-based capabilities on both the unclassified and classified levels. The Contractor will be required to provide all the end user devices to be used in this requirement.1.5 Period of Performance: The period of performance shall be for one (1) Base Year of", "chunk_id": 1, "page_no": 4}, {"chunk": "12 months and---four (4) 12-month option years with a six-month extension per FAR 52.217-8.
