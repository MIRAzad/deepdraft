Awards will be made to multiple small and large businesses. Awards will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offerors. Quotes will initially be screened for business size. Then will be placed in order of price (lowest price to highest price). GSA will then evaluate the technical factors of the lowest priced quote. GSA intends to make multiple awards to both large and small business firms based on lowest price technical acceptability. Accordingly, under this methodology, the technical factors of some quotes may not be evaluated by GSA. If discussions are deemed necessary by the CO, all quotes will be evaluated (both technical and price).An unacceptable rating for any of the evaluation criteria will result in the quotes being rendered technically unacceptable.This acquisition is being conducted under FAR 8.4. Selection of Offerors for BPA awards will be based on a comparative evaluation of quotes against the factors identified in this section. Principles and procedures of Subpart 15.3 do not apply. The Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers in accordance with FAR clause 52.215-1, or the Government may make award after clarifications of some aspects of the proposal or discussions relative to price only.

In these situations, the Government will consider the offeror\u2019s clarifying response(s) without allowing proposal revisions.c. Have communications; ask clarifying questions, request corrections relative to minorerrors in the price proposal, or request price substantiating documentation to facilitate the Government\u2019s final evaluation of cost proposals with one or some offerors. These communications, clarifications, or requests for corrections or substantiating documentation will not materially change the offeror's proposal in terms of conformance to RFQ requirements, constitute discussions such as the removal of an unacceptable assumption, or materially change pricing.Proposals shall set forth full, accurate, and complete information as required by this solicitation package (including Attachments).

GSA will confirm that the rates quoted do not exceed the IT Schedule 70 rates. Quotes containing inaccurate pricing information will be deemed ineligible for a BPA and will not be further evaluated.GSA will evaluate the Offerors provided GSA labor rate discounts on Attachment H.

For the purpose of pricing evaluation, the Offeror shall complete all labor rates, and every applicable cell (all yellow filled cells) on the attached Pricing Schedule (Attachment H). The pricing schedule includes estimated hours for each labor category. The estimated hours listed in the Pricing Schedule are for evaluation purposes only.
